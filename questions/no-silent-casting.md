Can I disable silent typecasting?

---

Doing data science in Python is error-prone, so I'm considering switching to a statically typed language, and Scala seems to be the only one with a big data science community. But I just discovered Scala will let me add a string to an integer. A compiler that silently converts types in the hope that nonsense will make sense is not what I want -- I want it to stop the show and confront me with what is probably an error.

Can I make Scala do that?
